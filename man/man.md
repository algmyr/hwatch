NAME

**hwatch** - A modern alternative to the watch command, records the differences in execution results and can check this differences at after.

SYNOPSIS
========

| **hwatch** \[*options*] *command*

DESCRIPTION
===========

**hwatch** is like *watch* command, repeatedly executes a *command* and displays its output.
However, the output results can be scrolled and displayed.
In addition, the difference of the execution result is recorded with the time stamp, and it can be checked later.
When checking, it is also possible to display the diff with the previous difference together.

If you specify it with options, the execution result can be recorded as a log with json.

It is the default keymap.


h

:   Show help message. Press the *h* key again to return to the previous screen.

:   Interprets ANSI colors and style sequences and displays them in color. This is the same as the *-c(--color)* option. Press the *c* key again to return to the original.


n

:   Outputs the line number at the beginning of the line.


r

:   Displays the output of the watch pane in reverse order.
